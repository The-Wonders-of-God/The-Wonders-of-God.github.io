<h2>Our family!</h2><br/>
This is my family. In our family it goes Jacob-Me-Naomi-Joshua-Nathan-Noah-Grace. You may be thinking, "Whoa! 7 kids! But if it is what God gives us, then let's thank Him. I love my big family and wouldn't want it any other way.<i> Psalms 127:3 Children are a heritage from the Lord.</i><br/>

Two years ago my Mom had a stroke. But she is okay because God used it to teach us. We learned so much through it. I wouldn't trade it for anything! In the last couple years we have gone through several hard things. I'm not going to talk about them right now, but in future posts I would like to share it with you.

<br/>Mom and grace!<br/>
