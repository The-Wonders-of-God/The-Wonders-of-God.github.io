<h2>I give up!</h2><br/>
Win you think badly about yourself you start to believe a lie! And it will make you sick because you can’t do it by yourself! 
<br/>If you have ever lissend to Otto Koning he is a missionary to head hunters and cannibals and he had a pineapple garden and the natives always stole his pineapples and it was hard to let go of is pineapples.
<br/>But win he did give up God took good care of his pineapples because they were steeling God’s pineapples! You have to surrender your rite to everything and god will bless it! I thought about what others that of me and it was a lie I need to think what God thought about me! <br/>And I surrendered and I don’t cared what other think about me because God tells me how much he loves me and I don’t have to weary because I know that my God is there!<br/>
