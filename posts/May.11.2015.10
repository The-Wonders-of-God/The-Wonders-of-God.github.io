<h2>I know</h2><br/>
I know how I am in Christ it is hard win people tell you that you are nothing. Have you Ever had someone say that I have it is very hared but Jesus knows he knows everything you go there and more it took me 6 months to rilly know that Jesus cared for me! God has so many wonders and we do not know them all not even close<br/>

We need to be exorbed in God's love! It seas in the bible that <i>If God is with us who can stand against us! Romans 8:31</i>
