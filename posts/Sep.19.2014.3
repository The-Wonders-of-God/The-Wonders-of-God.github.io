<h2>How can I find hope? </h2><br/>
well i like looking at the bible for my answers because it say in John 14:6 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father and less throw me! So if Jesus said that than we need to look at his word to follow what he says! Romans 8:24 for in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it will patience.   so god is here and he gives us hope in Jesus name, for as Jesus died for us we have hope and if we believe we will live forever with Jesus! Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.<br/>
