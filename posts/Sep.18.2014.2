<h2>I wonder?</h2><br/>
I wonder why God lets things happen? I wonder why God puts us in a certain time and a certain place?<br/>
John 15:19  As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. It is like a path in the woods that God has us follow.

because He loves me so much and He has a Perfect plan for me at this time and at this place.
thank you Lord!
